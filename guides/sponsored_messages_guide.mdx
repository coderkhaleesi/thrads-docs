# Integrating Sponsored Prompts

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on integrating sponsored messages within your conversational AI. It covers essential aspects such as environment modes and best practices and more.

## Production vs. Sandbox Mode

<Note intent="warning">
  **Important:** When integrating sponsored messages, it's crucial to distinguish between production and sandbox (non-production) environments.
  - In **sandbox mode** (`production=False`), ads are returned for testing purposes but are **not counted for monetization**.
  - In **production mode** (`production=True`), ads are live and contribute to monetization.
  Always ensure `production=True` is used *only* in your live production environment. For all testing and development, set `production=False`.
</Note>

## Using Sponsored Messages

    Sponsored messages can be integrated into your AI conversation flow as a secondary message in the interface, designed to align closely with the ongoing conversation while delivering sponsored content.

    **Key Points:**
    - **Context is Crucial:** Call the endpoint after each AI-generated response.
    <Note intent="warning">
    **Important:** You must call the endpoint at every turn—even if the ad isn't wanted (configurable via settings like `adFrequency`, explained below). This enables conversation tracking, ensures relevant follow-ups, and maintains ad effectiveness. Skipping it degrades performance and monetization.
   </Note>

    - **Control Ad Frequency:** Manage the number of ads shown using the `adFrequency` and `conversationalOffset` parameters.
    <Note intent="warning">
  **Important:** Even if you set a specific ad frequency, the ad may appear fewer times. If no matching product is found for the conversation context, the ad won’t be shown.
</Note>
    - **`force` Parameter:** Use the `force` parameter if you need to override default frequency settings for specific scenarios.

    **Code Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/message/get-ad/"

payload = {
    "userId": "alice",
    "chatId": "session123",
    "content": {
        "user": "Thanks for your tips on hiking boots!",
        "chatbot": "Glad it helped. Anything else you need?"
    },
    "metaData": { "user": "female" },
    "production": True,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 3,
    "conversationOffset": 2
}

headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/message/get-ad/";

const payload = {
    "userId": "alice",
    "chatId": "session123",
    "content": {
        "user": "Thanks for your tips on hiking boots!",
        "chatbot": "Glad it helped. Anything else you need?"
    },
    "metaData": { "user": "female" },
    "production": true,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 3,
    "conversationOffset": 2
};

const headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example Response

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "0.1.0",
  "requestId": "1ef7bd98-...",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-02T10:22:00Z",
  "docsUrl": "https://preview-docs.thrads.ai/",
  "totalTime": 0.72,
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Ad served successfully",
  "data": {
    "creative": "Try the new Salomon X backpack for extra comfort on long trails.",
    "prod_name": "Salomon X Backpack",
    "img_url": "https://example.com/backpack.jpg",
    "prod_url": "https://<domain>/api/v1/message/redirect/<token>"
  }
}
```
## Recommended Implementation Flow

This is the general recommended flow for the integration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User sends a message">
    Capture the user message and forward to your chatbot service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chatbot processes and responds">
    Your chatbot generates and returns a response
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Thrads API">
    As soon as the chatbot response is recived send both the user message and chatbot response to Thrads
  </Step>
  <Step title="Render Ad">
  Display the sponsored message as a second message, immediately following the chatbot’s response. We return JSON objects to provide maximum flexibility on the frontend; however, certain key UI elements must be included:

    -  Use a visually distinct style (different background color) to differentiate from regular messages
    - Include a clickable link to the product using the prod_url
    - Include product details: name, product_image, price (if available), and currency (if available)
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Metadata for Better Targeting

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "metaData": {
        "topic": "outdoor gear",
        "user_interests": "camping, hiking, outdoor",
        "conversation_stage": "gear_selection"
    },
    "production": True
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
const payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "metaData": {
        "topic": "outdoor gear",
        "user_interests": "camping, hiking, outdoor",
        "conversation_stage": "gear_selection"
    },
    "production": true
};
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Control Ad Frequency

Use `adFrequencyLimit` and `conversationOffset` to prevent ad fatigue:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 2,  # Maximum of 1 ad every 2 turns
    "conversationOffset": 5,  # Wait for 5 turns before showing ads
    "production": True
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
const payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 2,  // Maximum of 1 ad every 2 turns
    "conversationOffset": 5,  // Wait for 5 turns before showing ads
    "production": true
};
```

</CodeGroup>
### 3. **Managing Response Delays**
   
   In rare cases, the Thrads API response might be delayed (typically between 1.5–2 seconds). During this time, the user may begin typing a new question. **We recommend to have some logic in place to suppress the ad render if that arrives late.**
