# When to use sponsored search

Sponsored search uses contextual information to generate a suggested sponsored prompt for the user.
If the user clicks you get the moeny.

Sponsored search has two main use cases:
- Traditional search bar: a suggested prompt is provided and can be shown as a suggested search in the search bar. 
The ensdpoint also returns the equivalent "keyword search" which will be used by your backend to do the actual search.

- One sho generative platforms: 

## Production vs. Sandbox Mode

<Note intent="warning">
  **Important:** When integrating sponsored messages, it's crucial to distinguish between production and sandbox (non-production) environments.
  - In **sandbox mode** (`production=False`), ads are returned for testing purposes but are **not counted for monetization**.
  - In **production mode** (`production=True`), ads are live and contribute to monetization.
  Always ensure `production=True` is used *only* in your live production environment. For all testing and development, set `production=False`.
</Note>

## Using Sponsored Prompts

Sponsored prompts can be incorporated into your AI conversations in two primary ways: as an initial opener or as contextual follow-up questions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sponsored Opener">
    ### Starting Conversations with Sponsored Openers

    You can use the sponsored question endpoint to generate an "opener" – a question to initiate a conversation.

    **Key Points:**
    - **No Context Needed:** Simply call the endpoint without any prior conversational context.
    - **Tailored for Your App:** The API will provide a sponsored question suitable for your application, yet conversation-agnostic.
    - **Unaffected by `conversationalOffset` and `adFrequency` and `force`:** These parameters do not influence the behavior of opener prompts.

    **Code Example:**
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/get-ad/"

payload = {
    "userId": "123",
    "chatId": "123"
}
headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/get-ad/";

const payload = {
    "userId": "123",
    "chatId": "123"
};

const headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

    ### Incorporating Sponsored Follow-up Prompts

    To provide relevant sponsored content during an ongoing conversation, use the endpoint for follow-up prompts.

    **Key Points:**
    - **Context is Crucial:** Call this endpoint after each AI-generated response.
    <Note intent="warning">
    **Important:** You must call the endpoint at every turn—even if the ad isn't wanted (configurable via settings like `adFrequency`, explained below). This enables conversation tracking, ensures relevant follow-ups, and maintains ad effectiveness. Skipping it degrades performance and monetization.
   </Note>

    - **Control Ad Frequency:** Manage the number of ads shown using the `adFrequency` and `conversationalOffset` parameters.
    - **`force` Parameter:** Use the `force` parameter if you need to override default frequency settings for specific scenarios.

    **Code Example:**
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/get-ad/"

payload = {
    "production": True,
    "conversationOffset": 2,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 2,
    "userId": "123",
    "chatId": "123",
    "userRegion": "US",
    "content": {
        "user": "User message",
        "chatbot": "Bot message"
    }
}
headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/get-ad/";

const payload = {
    "production": true,
    "conversationOffset": 2,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 2,
    "userId": "123",
    "chatId": "123",
    "userRegion": "US",
    "content": {
        "user": "User message",
        "chatbot": "Bot message"
    }
};

const headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

## Recommended Implementation Flow

This is the general recommended flow for the integration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User sends a message">
    Capture the user message and forward to your chatbot service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chatbot processes and responds">
    Your chatbot generates and returns a response
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Thrads API">
    As soon as the chatbot response is recived send both the user message and chatbot response to Thrads
  </Step>
  <Step title="Render Ad">
    Display the sponsored prompt as a suggested follow-up question with visual branding:
    - Include the ad icon to displose advertisement (provided in response)  
    - Include the name of the brand (provided in response) for visual recognition
    - Present as clickable suggested questions below the chat, or as “tabbable” ghost text in the input bar (users can press Tab to accept the suggestion)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Click Tracking">
    Handle it just as explained below

## Handling Click Tracking

To ensure accurate monetization and analytics, you must track user clicks on sponsored messages.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive the Token">
    The sponsored prompts endpoint (for both openers and follow-ups) returns a unique `token` along with the sponsored question. Store this token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect User Interaction">
    When a user clicks or taps on the displayed sponsored question.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Click Confirmation">
    Immediately send a POST request to the `/api/v1/prompt/click/` endpoint. Include the `token` (received in Step 1) in the JSON body of your request.
    ```json
    {
      "token": "THE_UNIQUE_TOKEN_RECEIVED"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Reward Confirmation">
    A successful POST request to the click tracking endpoint will record the click and associate the reward.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Code Example for Click Tracking:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/click/"

payload = {"token": "<string>"}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://api.thrads.ai/api/v1/prompt/click/";

const payload = {"token": "<string>"};
const headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"};

const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Metadata for Better Targeting

```python
payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "metaData": {
        "topic": "outdoor gear",
        "user_interests": "camping, hiking, outdoor",
        "conversation_stage": "gear_selection"
    },
    "production": True
}
```

### 2. Control Ad Frequency (**Only for follow-up**)

Use `adFrequencyLimit` and `conversationOffset` to prevent ad fatigue:

```python
payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "chatId": "chat456",
    "content": content,
    "adFrequencyLimit": 2,  # Maximum of 1 ad every 2 turns
    "conversationOffset": 5,  # Wait for 5 turns before showing ads
    "production": True
}

```
### 3. **Managing Response Delays**
   
   In rare cases, the Thrads API response might be delayed (typically between 0.5-0.8 seconds). During this time, the user may begin typing a new question. **We recommend to have some logic in place to suppress the ad render if that arrives late.**
