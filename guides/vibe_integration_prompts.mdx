# Thrads Integration Prompt Library  
_Generic, language-agnostic prompts for any chat or search app_

---

## Prompt&nbsp;1 – **Pick the right endpoint**

> “Given the following API documentation, list which single endpoint best fits each of these actions in my app:  
> • showing a sponsored suggestion after a search query  
> • inserting a branded message inside an ongoing chat  
> • redirecting a user once they click an ad  
>   
> For each mapping, outline the **minimum request payload**, the expected success response shape, and any required authentication headers. Keep the answer technology-agnostic.”

---

## Prompt&nbsp;2 – **Generate boilerplate call + handler**

> “Using the docs below, produce a **framework-neutral** code sketch that:  
> 1) builds the request body with placeholders for all *required* fields,  
> 2) sends the call with exponential-backoff retries,  
> 3) parses the response and extracts the ad creative, token, and any tracking URLs, and  
> 4) exposes a simple `handleAdClick(token)` stub that reports the click.  
>   
> Return the answer in plain pseudocode so it can be ported to any language.”

---

## Prompt&nbsp;3 – **Drop-in middleware outline**

> “Write a high-level middleware/adapter pattern—no specific language—that sits between my search/chat UI and the Thrads API. Describe:  
> • where to intercept user input,  
> • how to check an **ad frequency limit** before calling the API,  
> • where to slot the sponsored content back into the UI flow, and  
> • how to log impressions and clicks for analytics later.  
>   
> Keep it architecture-agnostic (can apply to REST, GraphQL, or WebSocket setups). Bullet points only.”
