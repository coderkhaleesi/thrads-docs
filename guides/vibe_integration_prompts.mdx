# AI Coding Assistant Prompts for Thrads Integration

Copy-paste prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI coding assistant

Use these prompts when you already know what Thrads functionality you want to integrate and need implementation help from an AI coding assistant.

### How to use these prompts

1.⁠ ⁠*Choose your prompt* based on what you want to implement
2.⁠ ⁠*Replace placeholders* with your specific technology stack
3.⁠ ⁠*Copy the respective guide* from our itegration guides
4.⁠ ⁠*Paste both* into your AI coding assistant
5.⁠ ⁠*Refine the output* to match your coding standards and architecture

### Pro Tips

•⁠  ⁠Always specify your exact framework/language for better code generation
•⁠  ⁠Include your existing code patterns or style guide for consistency
•⁠  ⁠Ask for TypeScript definitions if you're using typed languages
•⁠  ⁠Request specific error handling patterns that match your app's architecture
•⁠  ⁠For large integrations, break it into smaller prompts focusing on one aspect at a time
