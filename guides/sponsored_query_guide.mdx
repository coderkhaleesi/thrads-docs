# When to Use Sponsored Query

Sponsored query uses contextual information to generate a suggested sponsored query (i.e. search/prompt) for the user.
If the user clicks, you get the money.

**Sponsored query has two main use cases:**

- **Traditional search bar**: A suggested query is provided and can be shown as a suggested query (i.e. search) in the search bar.
  The endpoint also returns the equivalent "keyword search" which will be used by your backend to perform the actual query.

- **One-Shot Generative Platforms**: Platforms where the user sends a query (i.e. prompt) to generate text or multimodal output.

## Production vs. Sandbox Mode

<Note intent="warning">
  **Important:** When integrating sponsored queries, it's crucial to
  distinguish between production and sandbox (non-production) environments. - In
  **sandbox mode** (`production=False`), ads are returned for testing purposes
  but are **not counted for monetization**. - In **production mode**
  (`production=True`), ads are live and contribute to monetization. Always
  ensure `production=True` is used *only* in your live production environment.
  For all testing and development, set `production=False`.
</Note>

## Using Sponsored Query

Sponsored queries can be incorporated into the two aforementioned kind of platforms.

    ### Sponsored Query in Traditional Search Bars

    Sponsored query returns a sponsored query to display in your search bar.

    **Key Points:**
    - **Tailored for Your App:** The API will provide a sponsored query suitable for your application.
    - **Make sure to set 'return_search_keywords' to true:** This will make the endpoint also return the equivalent of the query content as a keyword search which you can use to retrieve results in your backend.

    **Code Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/get-ad/"

payload = {
    "userId": "123",
    "return_search_keywords": True
}
headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/get-ad/";

const payload = {
  userId: "123",
  return_search_keywords: true,
};

const headers = {
  "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

    ### Sponsored Query in One-Shot Generative Platform

    You can use the sponsored query endpoint to generate a sponsored query (i.e. prompt) to show as a suggested query as ghost text or other preferred UI choice.

    **Key Points:**
    - **Tailored for Your App:** The API will provide a sponsored query suitable for your application.

    **Code Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/get-ad/"

payload = {
    "userId": "123",
}
headers = {
    "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/get-ad/";

const payload = {
  userId: "123",
};

const headers = {
  "Thrads-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

## Handling Feedback Tracking

To ensure accurate monetization and analytics, you must track user feedback on sponsored queries.



<Note intent="warning">
    **Important:** The user will always either click on the sponsored query or type their own query. In both cases, the /feedback endpoint must be called.
    If the user clicked, send it with the token and 'clicked':true, otherwise with the token and populated 'user_search'. 
    The user search is important to guarantee that over time the sponsored queries are targeted for the user, which ultimately enhances the user experience and your monetization.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive the Token">
    The sponsored query endpoint returns a unique `token` along with the sponsored query. Store this token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect User Interaction">
    When a user clicks or taps on the displayed sponsored query, or when the user types a different query instead.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Send Click Confirmation">
    Immediately send a POST request to the `/api/v1/query/feedback/` endpoint. Include the `token` (received in Step 1) in the JSON body of your request.

    ```json
    {
      "token": "THE_UNIQUE_TOKEN_RECEIVED",
      "clicked": true
    }
    ```

    or 

    ```json
    {
      "token": "THE_UNIQUE_TOKEN_RECEIVED",
      "user_search": "<ACTUAL USER QUERY>"
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Reward Confirmation">
    A successful POST request to the feedback tracking endpoint will record the click and associate the reward.
  </Step>

</Steps>

**Code Example for Click Tracking:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/feedback/"

payload = {"token": "<string>", "clicked": "<boolean>"}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const url = "https://dev.thrads.ai/api/v1/query/feedback/";

const payload = { "token": "<string>", "clicked": "<boolean>"};
const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});

const result = await response.text();
console.log(result);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Metadata for Better Targeting

```python
payload = {
    "userId": "user123",
    "metaData": {
        "user_gender": "Male"
    },
    "production": True
}
```

### 2. **Managing Response Delays**

In rare cases, the Thrads API response might be delayed (typically between 0.5-0.8 seconds). During this time, the user may begin typing a new query. **We recommend having some logic in place to suppress the ad render if it arrives late and it clashes with your UI choice.**

For detailed API specifications, please refer to the [API Reference for Sponsored Query](/api-reference/endpoint/query).
